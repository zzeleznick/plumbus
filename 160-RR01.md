### Summary:

The menu navigation of a biomedical product distributor, Clontech, is one of the most poorly designed, prominent features of website I have encountered. For our final project in the bioMEMS laboratory course (BioE 121L), we were tasked with creating a biomedical device prototype that could diagnose a specific disease state. During our research phase for planning our disease detection pipeline, we needed to compare the effectiveness of various nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). Noting that are multiple techniques for NAAT, each with their own limitations and test-kit specific protocols, intra- and inter-class comparison of NAATs on the market was essential for the thoroughness of our research. However, the designers of the website did not take the needs of first-time users into high regard.

The homepage of Clontech is unnecessarily complex, overloaded with information, and lacks clear explanatory text or direction. Notice that the navigation bar is hierarchal, with child elements propagating from parent elements whose text is stylistically distinguished with a tooltip following the last character. Yet, this implementation becomes unwieldy as some child list exceed 10 elements and extend towards the bottom of the page in a single, purple column jetting of the screen. Other relations force children of one navigation column to travel far in the horizontal direction with 4th-level descendants traversing nearly 75% of the page width. Worse, towards the right margin of the screen, child elements sometimes slide left and superimpose their parent containers, which defies the previous logic. The contradiction of common style guidelines and logic is noticeable on a large desktop display, and on mobile the site becomes practically unusable.

Had the Clontech web design team taken into account the principles of interaction design, additional designs would have been ideated, prototyped, and evaluated. While the current design might be more tolerable for repeat users of their PCR product line, Clontech should consider restructuring their homepage to optimize conversions. Assuming that large orders and continued sales to private research labs and major public institutions are their primary revenue stream, I can pragmatically understand that good (consumer-facing) web design would not be critical to their financial success. I would further hypothesize that orders are predominately done old-school with users manually filling in catalog numbers and quantities. Thus, while my inner-designer would propose that they refine their navigation menu to eliminate the chaining elements and instead include an auto-completing search bar, this site might be optimized for a different class of user needs. I would propose that another round of user testing be conducted to evaluate the current design and improve the usability of the site in relation to their KPIs.
